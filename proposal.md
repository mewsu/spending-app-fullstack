- If I had more time, I would have cleaned up the styling of the select section, added more error handling, and added more documentation.
- There could be different ways to approach this, for example we could make a call to XE each time a conversion needs to be make, or update our conversion table in a predefined interval. In the first approach, we would have more accurate data but could potentially increase the response time of the client request which could degrade the user experience. If we update on a interval, we would have to design a scheduled task that updates our data periodically, which could incur some minor upkeeping costs.
- If the list of accpeted currencies rarely change then we can store it on the client side as a type of enum. We would not have to make the call to retrieve this data each time and reduce the user's wait time to interactivity. A drawback would be, if this list does change then we would have to rebuild the client and deploy production files, which would cause minor outages for the affected pages.
