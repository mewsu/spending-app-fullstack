## Language & Tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - compatible with any version between v12 and v19
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - as a package manager
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - client-side framework
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - server-side framework

## Quickstart

This section contains all the information required for getting the server up and running. The application contains the following two directories:

- [server/](server/) - the server directory that contains the server code
- [client/](client/) - the client directory that contains the client code

In order to run the application, you will need to have both the server and client running in separate terminals.

### Server

To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the server directory (in Unix that would be `cd server`)

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Seed Data

(Optional) This will re-populate the database with data closer to-date

```bash
npm run seed
```

4. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

### Client

To run the client, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory (in Unix that would be `cd client`)

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

You can ignore the severity vulnerabilities, this is a [known issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11174) related to `create-react-app` and are not real vulnerabilities.

3. Start the client

```bash
npm start
```

## Formatting Client

To format your code using [prettier](https://prettier.io/), follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory (in Unix that would be `cd client`)

2. Run this command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To ensure you are using the correct version of prettier, make sure to format your code after installing the dependencies (`npm install`).

## Verify That Everything Is Set Up Correctly

To verify that the frontend is working properly, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the homepage that is titled "Welcome to My Spending App" and a chart as below.
